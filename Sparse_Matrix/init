This repo contains a Sparse Matrix implementation using Linked Lists

SparseMatrix_med.py : That file includes two main classes "MatrixEntry" and "SparseMatrix"

SparseMatrix_test_med.py : That file includes a unit test implementation to check the correctness of the implemented functions

basic_usages.py : That file includes basic usages of the implemented functions. You can create a Sparse Matrix, set any value to a given column & row, 
get any value from a given column & row, get the information about a whole row or col, a part of the Sparse Matrix or the whole Sparse Matrix

linkedlis_med.py : A Linked List implementation that I have also used in that Sparse Matrix example

For more detailed explinication about Sparse Matrices and how I implemented that code, you can check the following medium post :
